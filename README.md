# Project GitHub Search

In this project, I implemented interaction with the GitHub API and created the logic for adding favorite repositories to favorites and removing them from favorites, created a main page with a search for people by their nicknames and interacting with their repositories, created a favorite page where all the repositories you like are located and also when you click on them you will go to the repository itself.

## How to run a project locally:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
