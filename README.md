# Project GitHub Search

In this project, I implemented interaction with the GitHub API and created the logic for adding favorite repositories to favorites and removing them from favorites, created a main page with a search for people by their nicknames and interacting with their repositories, created a favorite page where all the repositories you like are located and also when you click on them you will go to the repository itself.

## How to run a project locally:

###

npm install
```

### 
```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
